## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
[I only used what was provided on the prework page.]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[I have barely done any type of website design. Therefore my skills in html, css, and javascript defineitely have room for improvement. The prework guide provided plenty of instructions and reading material for me to 
 be able to completely understand what each part of the project. I also found similarities between using html, css, and js with that of android app design.]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[My only previous experience with creating interfaces comes from just my time working of android app projects. Compared to that I found html, css, and js to look cleaner and simpler than xml and java. When I got into 
 incorporating databases into android apps it started to become quite a bit more complicated as it was no longer static views but had to populate itself based the queried data using adapters. 
 Does webdesign also require entirely new concepts that at first seem incredibly complex? ]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[At the time of submitting the prework I have only done completed the base game and if I spend for time on it in the future I would definitely addmore features. As it stands, having the same patern for every 
 iteration doesn't fulfill the goal of this type of memory game and implementing random patterns would be my first addition. While working on the project I also had the thought of allowing the user to decide their own
 difficulty with options for more or less buttons and, increased or decreased time between clues.]
